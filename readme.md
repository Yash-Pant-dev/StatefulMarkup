# Stateful Markup

## A quick and easy way to inject Reactivity, Components, Conditionals and Performant Rendering into vanilla JS projects

Have a large complex vanilla-js project and that would be so much more manageable to develop with React/XYZ, but don't want to migrate?
    
Or

Making a small new project and don't want to take on all the dependencies and the slowdowns due to a large framework or library?

Stateful Markup is made for you!
This framework allows you to inject state into your existing markup with no work at all.
### And the system is entirely opt-in, so you can supercharge only specific DOM trees if you wish.

### Contributing & Plugins
Stateful Markup would love your contribution in making it versatile for usage, whether it be the base engine or plugins that you find useful.
SM is built to be extended and also features its own plugin system for that very purpose. If a feature can be implemented as a plugin, it would typically be preferred over editing the existing engine.
